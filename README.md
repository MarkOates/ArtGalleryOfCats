# ArtGalleryOfCats

## Rules

### Genre: Fable: all characters are animals
There's only really one character in the game, Mittens, and he's a cat.

### Art: Iridescence
There's an object in one of the galleries that has an iridescent refraction
shader.  It's somewhat obsidian like.

### Art: All Dialog must be implemented comic-book bubble style
Mittens dialog happens with a bubble.

### Tech: Implement a chart (bar chart, pie chart, any kind of chart)
There's a bar chart in one of the galleries.

### Issues

You should be able to compile the "SourceRelease" version out-of-the box with only Allegro 5 as a dependency.  To compile, unzip the folder to a directory and `make`.  There's a lot of source being built, most of AllegroFlare is included in this "SourceRelease", so it will probably take a while to build (think 5 minutes or so).

Build has been tested on MSYS64 on Win, and `clang` on MacOS intel and arm.
